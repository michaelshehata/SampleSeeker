# SampleFinder
Easy sample finder.

This program allows a user to upload a song and find similar samples to it. BPM, Key, Genre are the main components of this system but there are multiple other features that the user could change to get as close as possible. These include Mood and metadata (year of publish, region, artist, etc).


To be implemented:
- Login (with library and history and a profile section)
- Favourites
- Settings (dark mode)
- Sample of the day section
